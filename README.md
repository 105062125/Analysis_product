Web built by **ReactJS + Flask + SQlite + Heroku**

## Frontend

First go to Analysis_product/frontend folder

## Backend

---

First go to Analysis_product folder

`source venv/bin/activate`

- open virtual environment called venv

`python app.py`

- open in debug mode (this will help testing)

## Cloud

---

Just push to this github master branch

I already set **_Heroku_** to this github repo

**_Heroku_** will detect this repo :)

Used Sqlite to store data.

You can use **_TablePlus_** to watch db file.
